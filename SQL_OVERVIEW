# DATABASE
- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
- A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
- So, DBMS is SQL Server, and the language weâ€™ll use is SQL. 
- SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control.
